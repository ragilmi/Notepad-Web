# Notepad Web Application - Dockerized

## Overview

This project is a web-based **Notepad Application** where users can create, view, and update notes. It is a full-stack application with the frontend built in **React** and the backend in **Node.js** using **Express**. The project is containerized using **Docker**, with **Docker Compose** managing the deployment of both the frontend and backend services. This setup ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies the deployment process.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js (using Vite for fast development)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose

---

## Application Features

1. **Frontend**:
   - A user interface built using React and served via Vite, where users can interact with the application.
   - Allows users to create, view, and update notes.
   - Utilizes a clean, modern UI using Vite for hot-reloading during development.

2. **Backend**:
   - A RESTful API built using Node.js and Express to manage notes.
   - Supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update).
   - Stores data temporarily in-memory for simplicity.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Deploying the Application Using Docker

### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the project repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/notepad-web.git
cd notepad-web
````

### 2. Install Docker and Docker Compose

Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. If not, follow these instructions:

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 3. Dockerize the Backend and Frontend

Each service (frontend and backend) has its own **Dockerfile**. The **docker-compose.yml** file is used to handle both services.

### 4. Docker-Compose Setup

The **docker-compose.yml** file coordinates the deployment of both frontend and backend services, ensuring they can communicate.

### 5. Build the Docker Containers

Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to build the Docker images:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 6. Run the Containers

Start the services with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

* **Frontend**: Available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* **Backend API**: Available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 7. Test the Application

You can now interact with the application:

* **Create a Note**: Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/notes` with the note content.
* **View Notes**: Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/notes` to fetch all notes.
* **Update a Note**: Use a PUT request to modify the content of an existing note.

## GitHub Repository

You can access the full source code, Dockerfiles, and the **docker-compose.yml** configuration in the GitHub repository:

* [Notepad Web GitHub Repository](https://github.com/your-username/notepad-web)

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to set up, develop, and deploy a full-stack web application using Docker and Docker Compose. By containerizing the app, the development and deployment process becomes more efficient and consistent across different environments.

## Next Steps

* Add persistent storage for the backend (using Docker volumes) instead of relying on in-memory storage.
* Implement user authentication and note-sharing functionality for future improvements.
